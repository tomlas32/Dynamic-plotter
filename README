# Dynamic Plotter

## Overview
Dynamic Plotter is a real-time data visualization tool for multi-sensor systems. The software reads data from a serial connection and plots the incoming values dynamically. The data is expected to be received in the following format:

```
0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
```

Each value corresponds to a different sensor channel. While not all functionalities are fully implemented, this project serves as a great starting point for those interested in real-time sensor data visualization.

## Features
- Real-time plotting of sensor data
- Serial connection support
- Basic GUI for monitoring sensor values
- Database integration with MongoDB

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- pyqtgraph
- pymongo (for database integration)

You also need a **`credentials`** module that provides the MongoDB connection details. Create a file named `credentials.py` and define the following:

```python
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://user:pw@ip:27017/"
DATABASE_NAME = "test"
COLLECTION_NAME = "pressure"
COLLECTION_NAME1 = "temperature"
```

This MongoDB setup is required to store the collected sensor data.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomlas32/Dynamic-plotter.git
   cd Dynamic-plotter
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and accessible with the credentials defined in `credentials.py`.

## Usage

1. Connect the sensors via the appropriate serial port.
2. Run the Multi-Sensor GUI:
   ```bash
   python gui_main.py
   ```
3. Data will be read in real-time from the serial connection and displayed in the GUI.

## Known Issues
- Some functionalities are not yet fully implemented.
- The GUI window size is fixed, which may cause display issues on different screen resolutions.
